# Welcome from TheBusyDev 👋

I am an **Aeronautical/CFD Engineer** from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/)...
But I also *love* coding! I specialize in scientific computing
for **Computational Fluid Dynamics** (CFD). 🌈 \
I usually simulate fluid-related stuff using `C++` and `Python`,
and I am currently working on *cardiovascular applications* 🫀...
